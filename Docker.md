## 1. What is Docker?

- Docker is like a virtual container for software applications. It allows you to package all the necessary files and dependencies of an application into a single standardized unit, called a container, which can be easily transported and run on any computer. 
- It simplifies the process of deploying and managing applications, making them more portable and consistent across different environments.

## 2. What Problem does Docker solve?

- <b>Compatibility:</b> Docker eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem by providing a consistent environment across different systems, ensuring that applications run reliably regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

- <b>Portability:</b>  Docker containers can be easily transported and run on any machine or platform, making it simpler to deploy applications in different environments and reducing the time and effort required for setup and configuration.

- <b>Resource Efficiency:</b>  Docker containers are lightweight and share the host system's resources, allowing for efficient utilization of computing resources. Multiple containers can run simultaneously on a single machine without conflicts.

- <b>Dependency Management:</b>  Docker simplifies the management of dependencies by packaging all the required libraries and dependencies with the application. This ensures that the application has all the necessary components to run without conflicts or compatibility issues.

- <b>Scalability:</b>  Docker facilitates easy scaling of applications by allowing quick replication and distribution of containers. It enables horizontal scaling, where additional containers can be added or removed to match the workload demands, providing flexibility and efficient resource allocation.

- <b>Collaboration:</b>  Docker enables teams to work collaboratively on applications by providing a standardized and reproducible environment. It ensures that developers, testers, and operators are all working with the same application configuration, making it easier to share and reproduce issues across different stages of the development lifecycle.

## 3. What are Containers?

- Containers are like lightweight, self-contained packages that hold everything needed to run a specific application or service, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. 
- They provide a consistent and isolated environment, making it easier to deploy, manage, and move applications across different systems without worrying about conflicts or dependencies.
- Containers are running instances of images that are isolated and have their own environments and set of process.

## 4. Why do we need Docker?

- Containers are like lightweight, self-contained packages that hold everything needed to run a specific application or service, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. 
- They provide a consistent and isolated environment, making it easier to deploy, manage, and move applications across different systems without worrying about conflicts or dependencies.
- It allow us to get rid of the matrix from hell !!

## 5. What can it do?

- Containerize Applications
- Run each service with its own dependencies in separate containers.

## 6. Run docker containers

```bash
  docker run <image_name>
```

## 7. What is an image?

- A docker image is can a template or blueprint for creating containers. It is a self-contained package that includes everything needed to run a specific application, such as the code, dependencies, libraries, and configurations. 
- An image is created from a set of instructions called a Dockerfile, and it serves as a portable and reproducible unit that can be used to create and run multiple instances of containers with consistent behavior and environment.
